# Contributing

Contributing to this project should be as easy and transparent as possible.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've changed the functionality, update the documentation.
3. If you've added new library/package, don't forget to add in package.json and update the README.md
4. Issue that pull request! :tada:
